Pattern Generator


Background:

The objective of this assignment is to practice advanced applications of selection structures.  In completing this assignment, the student will be able to:

Use while loops.
Use do … while loops
Use for loops.

General Instructions:

Create a new class named Patterns for this exercise.  When complete, hand in your completed project (Patterns.java file), in either a zip file containing your entire project or as a single file.

Each class the student creates must follow the commenting requirements below for full credit.  The programmer must replace the text in italics with information specific to the program.

//
//  Class author:  name of programmer
//  Date created:  date that the class was initially created.
//  General description: a brief summary of what this particular class does.
//

Each method a student creates must follow the commenting requirements below for full credit.  The programmer must replace the text in italics with information specific to the program.

//
//  Pre-condition: what must be true prior to the method being called //  including possible limitations on input
//  Post-condition: what the result of executing this method will be.
//


Assignment

Write a class containing a main method that calls other methods to produce each of the patterns listed below. Each method you write should accept an argument that will determine how many lines of the pattern are shown on the screen.   Use only the designated loop types.   Do not use switch statements.  Demonstrate each method by means of test commands provided in the main method of the class. 


Create a method with the signature:
public static void stars(int rows){}

Uses  while loops to print out the following pattern (shown with 7 rows):

*
***
*****
*******
*********
***********
*************


Create a method with the signature:
public static void triangle(int rows){}


Uses  do … while or while loops to print out the following pattern (shown here with 9 rows):

1
22
333
4444
55555
666666
7777777
88888888
999999999

Create a method with the signature:
public static void odds(int start){}


Use  for loops to print out the following pattern (shown here with start being 9):

999999999
7777777
55555
333
1



Create a method with the signature:
public static void eo(int maxE){}

Uses  loops of your choice to print out the following pattern (shown here with maxE equal to 6):

O
EE
OOO
EEEE
OOOOO
EEEEEE
OOOOO
EEEE
OOO
EE
O

Please note that if given an odd input you’ll need to start the first row with an “E” instead of an “O”, for example maxE = 5

E
OO
EEE
OOOO
EEEEE
OOOO
EEE
OO
E


Create a method with the signature:
public static void pyramid(int rows){}

Using loops of your choice print the pattern below (shown here with five rows):

     
111111111
 2222222
  33333
   444
    5


Rubric:




Excellent (3)
Reasonable (2)
Poor(1)
Missing(0)
The method stars is correctly initialized and produces accurate output that matches the rules provided given any possible input. The correct type of loop is used.








The method triangle is correctly initialized and produces accurate output that matches the rules provided given any possible input. The correct type of loop is used.








The method odds is correctly initialized and produces accurate output that matches the rules provided given any possible input. The correct type of loop is used.








The method eo is correctly initialized and produces accurate output that matches the rules provided given any possible input.








The method pyramid is correctly initialized and produces accurate output that matches the rules provided given any possible input.








The main method contains adequate testing and clearly demonstrates that each other method functions properly.








A header is present at the top of each class with your name/date/description. A pre/post condition comment appears above every method signature.
